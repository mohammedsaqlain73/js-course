//* ====================================

//* In JavaScript, values and variables are fundamental concepts that form the basis of programming.

//* Values:  A value is a piece of information that a program can work with. It can be a number, text, true/false, or more complex data.

//* Variables: A variable is a container that holds a value. It has a name and can be used to store and manipulate data in a program.

//* 1.varibales must start with a letter/underscore/dollar sign and have any special charecters.
//* 2.variable names have spaces.
//* 3.variables cannot be same as keywords.
//* 4.variable names are case sensitive.

// var $cityName = "New York";

// var my@Email = "john@example.com"; this is invalid as in js only letter
// underscore and dollar sign allowed no other special symbols.
